# Tree Shaker Prototype

\[WIP\] This is a JavaScript tree-shaker based on [Oxc](https://oxc.rs).

> If this project goes well, I personally hope it can become part of the Oxc or the Rolldown project.

## Goal

Tree shake the following code (this already works!):

```js
export function f() {
  function g(a) {
    if (a)
      console.log('effect')
    else
      return 'str'
  }
  let { ["x"]: y = 1 } = { x: g('') ? undefined : g(1) }
  return y
}
```

To:

```js
export function f() {
  return 1
}
```

May not be very fast, but should generates the least code possible.

## Todo

**Short term**:

- Track `this`

**Long term**:

- Pass all reasonable test262 tests
- Test against fixtures from other tree shakers like Rollup
- Implement built-in objects and properties
- Type narrowing

## Approach

1. Parse the code via `oxc_parser`.
2. Build the sematic information via `oxc_semantic`.
3. Tree shake the code.
    - Emulate the runtime behavior of the code. (Control flow, Side effects, ...)
    - Analyze the possible runtime values of the variables.
    - Remove the dead code.
4. Minify the code via `oxc_minifier`.

> Tree shake v.s. Minify:
>
> In this project, tree shake is to remove the dead code, while minify is to reduce the code size. They are different steps in the process.
